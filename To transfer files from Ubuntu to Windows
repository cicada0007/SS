#### Step 1: Set Up a Shared Folder in VirtualBox (If Ubuntu is a Virtual Machine)
1. **Install Guest Additions in Ubuntu**:
   - In VirtualBox, go to **Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image…**.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

2. **Create a Shared Folder in VirtualBox**:
   - Go to **VirtualBox > Settings > Shared Folders**.
   - Click the **+** icon to add a new folder.
   - Choose a folder on Windows you want to share, and set it as **Auto-mount** and **Make Permanent**.

3. **Access Shared Folder in Ubuntu**:
   - In Ubuntu, the shared folder will automatically be mounted under the `/mnt` directory.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the folder:
     ```bash
     cd /mnt/shared_folder_name
     ```
   - Replace `shared_folder_name` with the name of the folder you set up in VirtualBox.

#### Step 2: Copy Files to Shared Folder
1. **Copy Files in Ubuntu**:
   - Use the `cp` command to copy files to the shared folder:
     ```bash
     cp /path/to/your/file /mnt/shared_folder_name/
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/your/file` with the path to the file you want to transfer.

#### Step 3: Access Files in Windows
1. **Open the Shared Folder** in Windows, where you’ll see the transferred files.

### 3. Result
